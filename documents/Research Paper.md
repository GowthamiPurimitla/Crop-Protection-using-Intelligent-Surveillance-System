## Abstract
This research addresses crop damage caused by wildlife using a non-invasive automated system. The system combines **IoT sensors, AI algorithms (CNN & Haar Cascade), and GSM notifications** to:

- Detect animal movement  
- Identify species (wild vs domestic vs human)  
- Repel intruders with sound deterrents  
- Alert farmers in real-time  

This approach ensures 24/7 crop monitoring, protects wildlife, and improves agricultural productivity.
